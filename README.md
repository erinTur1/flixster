### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics in my labs definitely did prepare me to complete this project. Seeing examples of fetching API data and managing state between parents 
and children was a great way to get started. This project challenged me to use react state on a bigger scale with more components so it was a bit
tricky figuring out which components should store what state. However, after completing this project and facing these challenges, I have a much stronger understanding of React state and lifecycle.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have completed the last stretch feature, esecially since the second and third ones help complete the last one. If I
had more time I also would have taken the time to learn and try out useContext because I have been recommended it for managing react state by a mentor buddy.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I am really proud of my project demo! I made sure to showcase my understanding of the problem statement of Flixster and my implementation of it.
During my demo, not only did I highlight the core and stretch features I was successfully able to complete, I also highlighted some user-friendly experience additions I made. For example, notifications for: no search results, nothing being searched for, needing to click clear, and no more data on load more. I explained my thought process behind the importance of these features and how I looked at my project from the user's perspective throughout.

Some of my peers added animations to their webpages which I thought would be a cool thing to learn!

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Every instructor and mentor was very helpful throughout this project, but I will shoutout my peer fellow, Terrence Butler, for helping me gain a stronger understanding of React state and lifecycle when facing challenges in my project.
